### Introduction

Null pointer exceptions (NPEs) have long been considered one of the most notorious bugs in Java development. Tony Hoare,
who introduced null references in ALGOL W, even called it his "billion-dollar mistake." Java 8 introduced `Optional<T>`
as a solution to this problem, providing a container object that may or may not contain a non-null value. However,
simply using `Optional` isn't enoughâ€”using it correctly is crucial for writing robust and maintainable code.

In this guide, we'll explore `Optional` through a series of practical examples. We'll start with the basics and work our
way up to more advanced techniques. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use `Optional` to write
safer, more expressive Java code.

### The Basics: Understanding `Optional`

Let's start by looking at a common scenario: finding a student in a list. We'll first see the traditional approach, and
then we'll see how `Optional` can improve our code.

**Example 1: The Traditional Approach (Prone to NPE)**

```java
package academy.javapro;

public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}

```

```java
package academy.javapro;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class TraditionalStudentFinder {
    public static Student findStudent(List<Student> students, String name) {
        for (Student s : students) {
            if (s.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(name)) {
                return s;
            }
        }
        return null; // Danger zone!
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
        students.add(new Student("Alice", 20));
        students.add(new Student("Bob", 22));
        students.add(new Student("Charlie", 21));

        Student found = findStudent(students, "David");
        // This will throw a NullPointerException
        System.out.println(found.getName());
    }
}

```

Let's break this down. In our `TraditionalStudentFinder`, we're using a common pattern: returning null when we can't
find what we're looking for. It seems innocent enough, but it's actually a ticking time bomb in our code.

The problem arises when we try to use the result. Look at the main method. We're searching for "David", who isn't in our
list. When we try to print the name of the found student, boom! We get a `NullPointerException`.

The root of the issue is that our `findStudent` method's signature doesn't give any hint that it might not return a
student. It's all too easy to forget to check for null, leading to runtime errors that can be hard to track down.

### Understanding Optional: The Better Way

Now that we've seen the problems with null, let's explore `Optional`. The `Optional` class represents a container object
that may or may not contain a non-null value. Think of it as a special kind of box - you need to check if something is
inside before trying to use it.

**Example 2: Introducing `Optional`**

```java
package academy.javapro;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

public class OptionalStudentFinder {
    public static Optional<Student> findStudent(List<Student> students, String name) {
        for (Student s : students) {
            if (s.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(name)) {
                return Optional.of(s);
            }
        }
        return Optional.empty();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
        students.add(new Student("Alice", 20));
        students.add(new Student("Bob", 22));
        students.add(new Student("Charlie", 21));

        Optional<Student> foundStudent = findStudent(students, "David");

        // Safe way to use the result
        foundStudent.ifPresentOrElse(
                student -> System.out.println("Found: " + student.getName()),
                () -> System.out.println("Student not found.")
        );
    }
}

```

Now, this is much better! Let's walk through the changes we've made.

First, notice that our `findStudent` method now returns an `Optional<Student>` instead of just `Student`. This is a
clear signal to anyone using this method that it might not always find a student.

Inside the method, we use `Optional.of(s)` to wrap the student when we find one, and `Optional.empty()` when we don't.
This explicitly represents the two possible outcomes of our search.

The real magic happens in the main method. We use the `ifPresentOrElse` method to handle both cases: when a student is
found and when they're not. No more `NullPointerException`!

### Intermediate Techniques: Leveraging Optional's Power

Let's explore some more advanced features of `Optional`. These techniques will help you write even cleaner and more
expressive code.

**Optional Mapping and the Course Class**

```java
package academy.javapro;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Course {
    private final String title;
    private final List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();

    public Course(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }

    public void addStudent(Student student) {
        students.add(student);
    }

    public List<Student> getStudents() {
        return students;
    }
}

```

```java
package academy.javapro;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

public class OptionalMapping {
    public static Optional<Student> findStudent(List<Student> students, String name) {
        return students.stream()
                .filter(s -> s.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(name))
                .findFirst();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
        students.add(new Student("Alice", 20));
        students.add(new Student("Bob", 22));
        students.add(new Student("Charlie", 21));

        Optional<Student> foundStudent = findStudent(students, "Alice");

        Optional<String> upperCaseName = foundStudent.map(s -> s.getName().toUpperCase());

        upperCaseName.ifPresent(name -> System.out.println("Uppercase name: " + name));
    }
}

```

In this example, we're introducing the `map()` method of `Optional`. Think of `map()` as a way to transform the contents
of an `Optional` without worrying about whether it's empty or not.

First, notice how we've simplified our `findStudent` method using streams. This is a more concise way to create
an `Optional<Student>`.

The interesting part is how we use `map()`. We take our `Optional<Student>` and transform it into an `Optional<String>`
containing the uppercase name of the student. If no student was found, `upperCaseName` would simply be an
empty `Optional`.

### Advanced Techniques: Working with Multiple Optionals

```java
package academy.javapro;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

public class CombiningOptionals {
    private static final List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
    private static final List<Course> courses = new ArrayList<>();

    public static Optional<Student> findStudent(String name) {
        return students.stream()
                .filter(s -> s.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(name))
                .findFirst();
    }

    public static Optional<Course> findCourse(String title) {
        return courses.stream()
                .filter(c -> c.getTitle().equalsIgnoreCase(title))
                .findFirst();
    }

    public static Optional<Double> calculateAverageGrade(Optional<Student> studentOpt, Optional<Course> courseOpt) {
        return studentOpt.flatMap(student ->
                courseOpt.flatMap(course ->
                        Optional.of(computeAverageGrade(student, course))
                )
        );
    }

    private static double computeAverageGrade(Student student, Course course) {
        // Simplified grade computation
        return 85.5;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        students.add(new Student("Alice", 20));
        courses.add(new Course("Java 101"));

        Optional<Student> student = findStudent("Alice");
        Optional<Course> course = findCourse("Java 101");

        Optional<Double> averageGrade = calculateAverageGrade(student, course);

        averageGrade.ifPresent(grade -> System.out.println("Average grade: " + grade));
    }
}

```

Here we're working with multiple `Optional` objects. The `calculateAverageGrade` method takes two `Optional` parameters
and returns an `Optional<Double>`. The magic happens in how we chain `flatMap` operations to handle both `Optional`
inputs. This ensures that the average grade is only calculated if both a student and a course are present.

### Optional in Streams

```java
package academy.javapro;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

public class OptionalInStreams {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
        students.add(new Student("Alice", 20));
        students.add(new Student("Bob", 22));
        students.add(new Student("Charlie", 21));
        students.add(new Student("David", 23));

        double averageAge = students.stream()
                .map(Student::getAge)
                .filter(age -> age > 20)
                .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                .average()
                .orElse(0.0);

        System.out.println("Average age of students over 20: " + averageAge);

        Optional<Student> oldestStudent = students.stream()
                .reduce((s1, s2) -> s1.getAge() > s2.getAge() ? s1 : s2);

        oldestStudent.ifPresent(s -> System.out.println("Oldest student: " + s.getName()));
    }
}

```

This example showcases how `Optional` integrates seamlessly with Java streams. We perform two operations:

- Calculating the average age of students over 20, using `orElse(0.0)` to provide a default value if no students match
  our criteria
- Finding the oldest student using reduce, which returns an `Optional<Student>`

### Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Using `Optional.ofNullable()` for Safe Creation:** `Optional.ofNullable()` is the cornerstone of safe `Optional`
  creation. When working with values that might be null, such as results from database queries or external API
  calls, `ofNullable()` provides a safety net. It gracefully handles both null and non-null values, creating an
  empty `Optional` when the input is null and wrapping the value when it's present. This eliminates the risk of null
  pointer exceptions at the creation phase and sets the foundation for safe value handling throughout your code.
- **Avoiding `Optional.of()` with Null Values**: `Optional.of()` should be used with extreme caution, and only when you
  are absolutely certain that a value cannot be null. Using `Optional.of()` with a null value will immediately throw
  a `NullPointerException`, defeating the entire purpose of using `Optional`. This is particularly dangerous when
  dealing with values from external sources or method parameters where null values might be possible. Always
  prefer `Optional.ofNullable()` unless you have a specific reason to enforce non-null values.
- **The Dangers of `get()`**: The `get()` method is considered an anti-pattern in `Optional` usage. While it might seem
  like a straightforward way to retrieve a value, it can throw `NoSuchElementException` if the `Optional` is empty. This
  behavior mirrors the very null pointer exceptions that `Optional` was designed to prevent. The method exists primarily
  for legacy compatibility and specific edge cases where you are absolutely certain of value presence, but its use
  should be avoided in normal application flow.
- **Safe Alternatives with `orElse()` and `orElseGet()`**: Instead of `get()`, `Optional` provides safer alternatives
  for value retrieval. `orElse()` allows you to specify a default value that will be returned if the `Optional` is
  empty. `orElseGet()` goes a step further by accepting a supplier function, which is only executed if the `Optional` is
  empty. This lazy evaluation is particularly useful when the default value is expensive to compute. These methods
  ensure that your code always has a valid value to work with, eliminating the risk of runtime exceptions.
- **Conditional Execution with `ifPresent()`**: The `ifPresent()` method provides a clean way to execute code only when
  a value is present. Instead of checking for null or using `isPresent()` followed by `get()`, `ifPresent()` accepts
  a `Consumer` function that is only called when the `Optional` contains a value. This leads to more concise and
  expressive code, particularly when performing operations that don't need to return a value, such as logging or sending
  notifications.
- **Comprehensive Handling with `ifPresentOrElse()`**: Building upon `ifPresent()`, `ifPresentOrElse()` allows you to
  handle both the presence and absence of a value in a single expression. It takes two arguments: a `Consumer` for when
  the value is present, and a `Runnable` for when it's empty. This method is particularly useful for scenarios where you
  need different behaviors for each case, such as updating UI elements or managing application state, without resorting
  to verbose if-else statements.
- **Transformations with `map()` and `flatMap()`**: Map operations provide a powerful way to transform `Optional`
  values. `map()` applies a transformation to the value if present, automatically wrapping the result in
  an `Optional`. `flatMap()` is essential when dealing with methods that return `Optionals` themselves, preventing
  nested Optionals. These operations can be chained together, enabling fluent and readable transformations of data
  without explicit null checks.
- **Filtering Values**: The `filter()` method allows you to add conditions to your `Optional` processing chain. It takes
  a predicate and returns an `Optional` that is empty if either the original `Optional` was empty or the predicate
  returns false. This is particularly useful for validating values or implementing business rules without breaking
  the `Optional` chain or resorting to external if statements.
- **Collection Handling Best Practices**: When working with collections, return empty collections rather
  than `Optional<Collection>`. This simplifies the code as empty collections already represent the absence of values and
  can be safely iterated over. `Optional` should be reserved for cases where there truly is a semantic difference
  between an absent value and an empty collection.
- **Optional as Return Types**: `Optional` should primarily be used as a return type for methods that might not return a
  value. This creates clear API contracts and forces clients to consider the possibility of absent values.
  However, `Optional` should not be used as a parameter type, as it complicates method calls and can lead to confusion
  about null handling requirements.
- **Performance Considerations**: While `Optional` provides many benefits, it does come with a small performance
  overhead due to object creation and method invocation. In performance-critical code paths or high-throughput
  scenarios, consider whether the benefits of `Optional` outweigh the performance impact. Sometimes, traditional null
  checks might be more appropriate for these specific cases.

### Conclusion

`Optional` is a powerful tool for handling null values in Java, but it needs to be used correctly to be effective. By
following these best practices and understanding the underlying concepts, you can write more robust and maintainable
code. Remember that the goal of `Optional` is not just to avoid null pointer exceptions, but to make your code more
expressive and your APIs more clear about their contracts.
